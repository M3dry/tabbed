/* Patches */

/* This patch allows tabbed to handle windows with transparency.
 * You need to uncomment the corresponding line in config.mk to use the -lXrender library
 * when including this patch.

 */
#define ALPHA_PATCH 1

/* This patch hides the tab bar if only one tab is open.
 * https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/patches/autohide/
 */
#define AUTOHIDE_PATCH 1

/* This patch prints the position number of the client before the window title.
 * https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/patches/clientnumber/
 */
#define CLIENTNUMBER_PATCH 0

/* This patch hides all the tabs and only shows them when Mod+Shift is pressed. All functions
 * with switching, rotating, and creating tabs involve Mod+Shift. When not doing one of these
 * functions, visibility of the tabs is not needed.
 * This patch relies on the keyrelease patch to support show/hide on keypress/keyrelease.

 */
#define HIDETABS_PATCH 1

/* This patch gives tabbed an icon. This icon is the currently selected tab's icon.
 * If the selected tab has no icon (or no tab is selected), use a (admittedly ugly) default icon.
 *
 * This patch supports both the new EWMH (_NET_WM_ICON) and
 * legacy ICCCM (WM_ICON) ways of setting a window's icon.

 * the keyboard layout independent.

/* This patch enables for function handling on KeyRelease events.
 * For example usage see: hidetabs
